        <p> <b>Portfolio</b>
            <br> This page is dedicated to my past skills and learnt languages/tools which were commonly used.

    <div class="second-text"><h3 id="frontEnd"> Front End
        <br> *HTML + CSS + JavaScript
        <br> These skills were learnt at together during my 4th semester which was at the start of 2022.
        <br> Im pretty confident in them as its the recent one although it is confusing compared to the rest. 
        <br> *Visual basic
        <br> This one was pretty easy as it is mainly used for form designs and user interactions with the system.</h3></div>
    <div class="third-text"><h3 id="backEnd"> Back End
        <br> *Java
        <br> Java was taught in 2 semester, 1 was the basic whilst the other was more in-depth.
        <br> Im quite confident in my abiliites in Java but Object Oriented Languages is a large sea that I have yet to embark on.
        <br> *C++
        <br> It is a simple and old language but it is quite in-depth as its used in a lot of game engines.
        <br> *mySQL
        <br> I have years of experience with mySQL dating back to my highschool days.
        <br> Therefore I am confident in my abilities at tables with SQL. </h3></div>
    <div class="fourth-text"><h3 id="design"> Design
        <br> *Photoshop
        <br> I spent quite some freetime at photoshop and I was taught about design during my first semester.
        <br> But I would not call myself a professional by any means. </h3></div>
